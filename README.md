# Telegram-Bot-Home-Tasks
> I created this bot for my roommates because we needed a plan to manage household chores. The bot uses an array where we store various tasks. Its purpose is to randomize these tasks every 7 days, ensuring that we never repeat the same task within that timeframe.

For run this bot you need your telebot token, you can get it at **BotFather** _(it's a telegram bot to create your new bot)_ , just say 
```` telegram
/newbot

````
follow the steps and **copy the HTTP API** *(it's your telebot token)*

On the other hand to get your **Chat ID** you need to execute
````Python 
Chat_ID.py
````
And type anything in your bot, you will see your Chat ID in your python console
